## Overview
### Page
Check out the project [here](https://noliv197.github.io/main-css-assignment/)
### Instructions
1. Recreate the page design as similar as possible. 
   * Use the information on font-size, font-weight, colors and background-colors provided 
2. The website must have 3 pages in total
3. Content of the website is up to the group
4. Make the website responsive and create a semantic HTML structure
5. Only basic HTML and CSS are allowed. __NO libraries, frameworks or SASS are allowed!__
* __Suggestions__: 
    * For the section you’re working on, begin by getting all the content onto the page before beginning to style it.
    * Take it one section at a time. The website you’re creating has 4 main sections (and a footer), so pick one and get it into pretty good shape before moving on. Starting at the top is always a solid plan.
